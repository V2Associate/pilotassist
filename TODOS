Issues: 

- The app with the current design doesn't sell the name. See Quora design where AppShell has only the name and action Icons
Below that is a tab
- Need to add the meta tag (refer PWA course) for full screen
- Fields validation for the NewTripDetail page
- If there is nothing rostered then show empty div
- validation

Doubts:

- Have used position: relative extensively with px any issues that we need to forsee due to that
- Why the scroll bar appears

- From to started at and landed at this is the order
- Validation for overlapping timing
- Red color delete
- Footer was not visible
- co-pilot name
- Night flight  different color
- There could be flights going over the night
