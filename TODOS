Issues: 

- The app with the current design doesn't sell the name. See Quora design where AppShell has only the name and action Icons
Below that is a tab
- Need to add the meta tag (refer PWA course) for full screen
- Fields validation for the NewTripDetail page
- Updating footer values

Doubts:

- Have used position: relative extensively with px any issues that we need to forsee due to that
- Why the scroll bar appears

server side tasks:

 Need to create a mysql user for accessing pilotassist
 Create proper index for the tables
 Add a column to trip_details to see whether it's Automatic or manual addition
 Change DOB to Date instead of unixtimestamp
 Need to have a cleaner way to start the server, might be through yarn


Veda Review ( Feb - 16th)

- Remark
- 24 hrs no colon
- Registration of the flight
- Everything should be in Caps
-Display of 24 hrs also should be without :
- From to started at and landed at this is the order
- Validation for overlapping timing
- Red color delete
- Footer was not visible
- co-pilot name
- Night flight  different color
- There could be flights going over the night 


server todo:

 - Auto reloading is not working
 - Do we need to write setup.py if so purpose of it
 - Check the TODO within code

 TODO for route branch
  - insert checking the src and destination. if there is no such route and destination exists then insert new and then start 
  - GMT is giving some issue, When we post any trip b4 3:30 it's not getting displayed, example add AI-1902
